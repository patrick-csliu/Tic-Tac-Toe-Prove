## Goal
Proof that no one can win the game if each player chooses the right action choice.
To proof that, first we must proof stater must win, than proof second player must win, if both assumption are not true, than we can proof what we want.

### First, proof stater must win
* Denote w = o must win (bool)
* ![](1.jpg)
* Python script: ox.py

### Second, proof second player must win
* Denote w = x must win (bool)
* ![](2.jpg)
* Python script: ox2.py
